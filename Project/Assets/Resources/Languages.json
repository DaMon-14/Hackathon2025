By properly separating plastic, paper, glass, and household waste, we help reduce pollution and save natural resources. Every small action matters — recycling helps decrease the amount of waste sent to landfills and transforms old materials into new products. It is everyone’s responsibility to keep the planet clean for future generations."}
